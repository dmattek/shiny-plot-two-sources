# Plot data from different sources

### A follow-up to Stephen McDaniel's response to Shiny Google Groups thread

**Main issue:** by and large my Shiny apps process data loaded from a file. However, for
testing and/or demonstration purposes it is often convenient to include
an option that would generate an equivalent dataset. The solution is to
create and app where data can be generated by a button press or loaded from a file

**In this example**, we have two buttons that generate random numbers from
Gaussian and Poisson distributions, respectively. Additinally, we have
an option to load a single-column text file with numbers. A histogram
will be plotted for any of these datasets.

The code relies on:

  1. Stephen McDaniel's solution to track usage of the action buttons
  and determine which data to utilize.

  2. [ShinyJS](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) library by Dean Attali to reset the state of `fileInput`
  such that the file with the same name can be re-loaded consecutively.
